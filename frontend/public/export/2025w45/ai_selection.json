      "summary": "Organizations care about tech optionality — not just to avoid vendor lock-in, but also to make sure they’re using the best tool for the job. This particularly applies to AI agents. The more tools and systems at an agent’s disposal, the better the agent. Dataiku has always aimed to put these tools in the hands of a diverse range of users, which is why we’re excited to provide no-code UIs to build AI agents leveraging the entire Snowflake Cortex AI stack in conjunction with the release of Snowflake Intelligence.",
