      "summary": "You open your analytics workspace and see forty new AI-generated alerts before your first meeting. A few of these signals could change next quarter’s numbers. Most are noise. Data is everywhere, and AI runs without rest. Dashboards refresh faster, models retrain overnight, and agents surface insights in real time. Yet decisions still stall. The real restriction in analytics today isn’t access or speed. It’s attention, specifically human attention, the kind that knows how to separate what matters from what merely looks interesting.",
