Instead, it’s an approach to interoperability where both frameworks coexist and serve different purposes within a unified data architecture. By understanding fundamental storage patterns, implementing effective catalog strategies, and using native storage capabilities, you can build scalable, high-performance data architectures that support both your current analytics needs and future innovation.",
