      "summary": "Managing a global corporate network at Uber’s scale can feel a bit like running an ultra-marathon. There are long stretches of smooth sailing, but you’re always preparing for the unexpected mountain pass or sudden change in weather. For years, our engineering teams have navigated this terrain with a traditional, monolithic monitoring system. We knew we needed to switch to a modern pair of carbon-fiber running shoes. This meant a complete overhaul: a journey to replace our legacy system with a cloud-native observability platform built for speed, flexibility, and endurance on an open-source stack.",
